All fields have unique and shared properties. Properties unique to each field will be shown on each of the components'
pages respectively.

## Shared properties
These are all properties that are shared between most of the field schema objects. There are however, some exceptions to
this rule like [`FieldButton`](/guide/fields/FieldButton).
